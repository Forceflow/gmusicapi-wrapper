This is a fork of [TheBigMunch](https://github.com/thebigmunch)'s gmusicapi-wrapper, which stopped working at the end of 2018 because of incompatibilities with gmusicapi. TheBigMunch is now working on his own api [google-music](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music).

I'm maintaining these set of scripts for people (like me) who have uploaded their music coollections using the original [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi), and would like to continue to do so.
