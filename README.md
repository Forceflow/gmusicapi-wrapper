This is a fork of [TheBigMunch](https://github.com/thebigmunch)'s [gmusicapi-wrapper](https://github.com/thebigmunch/gmusicapi-wrapper), which stopped working at the end of 2018 because of incompatibilities with gmusicapi. TheBigMunch is now working on his own api [google-music](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music) ([reasons here](https://gist.github.com/thebigmunch/eeb994094f53ac1d62ea7bc823876de9)). His original repo is archived and does not accept PR requests anymore, hence this fork.

I'm maintaining these set of scripts for people (like me) who have uploaded their music collections using the original [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi), and would like to continue to do so until they want to switch to another API.
