# About gmusicapi-wrapper

This is a fork of [TheBigMunch](https://github.com/thebigmunch)'s archived [gmusicapi-wrapper](https://github.com/thebigmunch/gmusicapi-wrapper), which stopped working at the end of 2018 because of incompatibilities with changes in [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi). 

TheBigMunch is now working on his own api [google-music](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music) and all the tools that surround it, be sure to check that out as well. His original repo of this wrapper was archived and does not accept PR requests anymore, hence this fork. Starting with **0.7**, this wrapper will be based on my modifications.

I'm maintaining this wrapper for people who have uploaded their music collections using the original [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi) from Simon Weber, and would like to continue to do so (or until they want to switch to another API).

# Installation

For now, the best way to install is to just do `pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/Forceflow/gmusicapi-wrapper.git` to get the latest version.

# Usage

A good set of scripts to use with this wrapper (to sync your music, for example) is [gmusicapi-scripts](https://github.com/Forceflow/gmusicapi-scripts).
